This is a spec for the way that Latin word forms are subclassified. The top level choice is between Substantive and Verb forms. 

GRAMMAR SELECTION:
    Substantive (Words used as nouns, pronouns, and adjectives,)
            Substantive words follow patterns called declensions, which define the way the word endings change based on the stratifications listed below. These stratifications do not exclude each other; selections from this list can be made independently. Multiple selections would be useful.
        Case:
            ANY
            Nominative
            Genitive
            Dative
            Accusative
            Ablative
            Vocative
            Locative
        Gender:
            ANY
            Masculine
            Feminine
            Neuter
        Participle:
            ANY
            Present Active Participle
            Comparative of Present Active Participle
            Superlative of Present Active Participle
            Future Active Participle
            Perfect Passive Participle
            Comparative of Perfect Passive Participle
            Superlative of Perfect Passive Participle
            Gerundive
            Comparative of Adverb or Adjective
            Superlative of Adverb or Adjective
        Number:
            ANY
            Singular
            Plural
    Verb
            Similar to the ways substantives follow patters called declensions, verbs follow patterns called conjugations, which define the patterns their endings follow.
        Mood:
            ANY
            Indicative
            Subjunctive
            Infinitive
            Imperative
        Tense:
            ANY
            Present
            Imperfect
            Future
            Perfect
            Pluperfect
            Future Perfect
        Voice:
            ANY
            Active
            Passive
