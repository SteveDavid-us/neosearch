1/27/2009 - change description

1. Made CGiant::GetRoseCode a non-inline function to fix the release build.
2. Removed ns2osx framework because it was a pain to have the separate xcode projects. Now it is all statically linked together; there is no header copy or anything. ns2osx.framework 
3. Moved data and texts directory pointers to CWD to facilitate release build. Now the data and text directories must exist in the build/Debug and build/Release directories to run Neosearch from Xcode, or they must be in the drive root for the built app to be run directly (e.g. via finder).
